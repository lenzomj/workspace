## Getting Started with `mkdocs`
The following commands will install `mkdocs` with the material theme.

```bash
$ python3 -m pip install --user mkdocs mkdocs-material
```

Call `mkdocs -h` to see a list of commands. `build` generates the `site`
directory and `serve` provides a live preview over `localhost`.

```bash
$ mkdocs new [dir-name]
$ mkdocs build [serve]
```
